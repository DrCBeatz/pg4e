Important: Getting Past the Coursera Firewall

For this course you will need a PostgreSQL client to enter your SQL commands and communicate with the PostgreSQL server that we will provide.  You will also need to access your PostgreSQL server from Python. 
Your server details will be a server, account, and password as follows: 
Server: 35.239.58.248 
Port:  9023
User: postgres 
Password: EwhRrj1lviopNp0 
or
Server: 35.239.58.248 
Port: 9023
User: pg4e_user_9e123 
Password: pg4e_pass_e1234 
We provide a Coursera Labs Jupyter notebook for you to run the example code and do your assignments.  
The Coursera Labs notebooks run behind a firewall to keep you from accessing unauthorised servers.   Your Postgres servers run in Amazon and not inside Jupyter labs, so we need to build a "small virtual private network" to make it so your Coursera Labs terminal can access your server using a technique called "ssh port forwarding" or "ssh tunnelling" as we are opening a small "tunnel" through a firewall just for our traffic.  If there was no firewall you could access pg4e database in the above server using the following command and entering your password.   
psql -h 35.239.58.248 -p 9023 -U pg4e_user_93123 pg4e   
But if you are behind a firewall, this won't work.  Luckily, the entire University of Michigan campus is authorized and so using ssh port forwarding we can bounce packets through the University of Michigan.  
Activating your Linux Account at UM 
First you need to get access to the University of Michigan login servers by requesting an account:
https://ifsprovisioning.its.umich.edu/ifs_storage/request 
It takes few hours for your account to be active and it happens between 8-5 on weekdays in Eastern time - so make the request and be patient.  Ignore all the links to "MFile" on that page.   Mfile is another UM service available to you but we won't be using it.   
You will know that your account is activated when you can log in to your Universiity of Michigan Linux Server with your password:  
 ssh csev@login.itd.umich.edu   
Use your account instead of "csev".  This login uses your UMich password. Until your account is active this will simply refuse to log you in.  It is a Linux system, you can logout by typing "logout". 
Port Forwarding from Coursera to PostgreSQL through University of Michigan
Now we will go into Coursera and find the "ungraded" assignment called "Access to Terminal" - you will use this throughout the course to do your homework.   Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open two terminals in two separate tabs.  Note that you might want to check the "Running" tab in your notebook in case you already have running terminals.  If you already have terminals - just use those terminals - don't start new ones.  In one of the tabs/terminals, type the following command:
ssh -4 -L 9023:35.239.58.248:9023 csev@login.itd.umich.edu   
Use your server IP address and your account instead of "csev".  You will be asked for your UMich password and be logged into login.itd.umich.edu.  It is a bit weird, but the port forwarding is a side-effect of being logged in.  You will leave this terminal logged in as long as you want to use port forwarding.   
If you log out of your UMich account or destroy a Jupyter window, port forwarding will stop working.  Once port forwarding is up and running, switch to the other tab and type the following command:   
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9023 -U pg4e_user_93123 pg4e   
Enter your PostgreSQL password.  What is happening is quite simple.  Your first tab is "listening" on port 9023 on the local computer (running inside Coursera). When it gets a connection, it tells login.itd.umich.edu to open a connection to your server and then ssh simply passes all data back and forth through the ssh tunnel.  To take the tunnel down, either log out from the UMich login server in the tunnel tab using "logout" or close the terminal from Jupyter.
Interestingly, if you close the tab and don't log out, Jupyter will keep it running for a while.  Eventually it will get shut down if you don't use it for a while.  You can always check to see what terminals are running by looking at the "Running" tab in the notebook.
